#### Intro
I am a Full Stack Engineer based in Paris, France specialising in developing platforms and pipelines for machine learning based systems. I also have a keen interest in data driven front-end development. I have been a passionate developer since 2015, and have since completed my masters in machine learning and data mining.
<br>
While I might not be available for freelance work at the moment, I am always open to new ideas with a great social impact, and I would love to be part of a team that would bring an innovative idea to reality.
<br>
I firmly believe that we can build a sustainable, environmentally friendly future through the proper use of technology.
<br><br>
#### Currently
At AZmed, I have learned how to build impactful and innovative applications, and to manage the deployment and scaling of software in distributed architectures. I have also learned how to build partnerships with people across the globe.
<br/>
At AZMed, we developed Rayvolve, an AI driven diagnostic tool for medical radiography, which is the first French CE-marked medical device in its category.

#### Some history

- I first saw a computer (at that time, a wierd looking TV) around 1994, at an exhibition at the university where my father worked.

- I got my first PC in 2009, when I was already 19. My first phone, a Nokia feature phone, followed next year, which sadly meant that I had completely missed the SMS era. Alas!

- I made my first contribution to wikipedia about a [Remote sub-railway station](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polwathumodara_railway_station) in 2012 (Attention, the timetable is not upto date!), the first of many.

- I also started translating open-source software around this time.

- At 23, despite graduating in IT Management, I grew an interest in front-end development, and created my first GUI using visual basic.

- At 24, I completed my first freelance web project.

- By 2015, at 25, I was a full time web developer.

- Switched to remote working for a couple of years starting from 2015, well before it became the norm.

- By 2017, I was a full time iOS developer.

- In 2019, I graduated with a masters degree in machine learning.

- Got interested in dev-ops during my time at AZMed from 2019, I've never looked back since.

You can ask me in person for other stories that I'm afraid to share with the internet.

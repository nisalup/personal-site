      <p>First of all, why I did I end up having my own website?<br/>
        I am not exactly famous, and history confirms that no Software Engineer whose 
        favorite food used to be <i>Kebab Steak</i> with <i>Sauce Alg√©rienne</i> ever was. <br/>
        I use this site mainly to showcase my travel photos, share my (mostly technical) articles 
        and specially for potential collaborators who would like to work with me 
        on (hopefully) cool, sustainable and impactful projects. <br/>
        Oh, and for recruiters <i>(Bonjour!)</i> in case I ever find myself job dating.<br/>
        Please do feel free to read my <Link to="/about">about me</Link> section,
        or to check out my {' '}
        <Link to="/resume">resume</Link>, {' '}
        <Link to="/projects">projects</Link>, {' '}
        or to <Link to="/contact">contact</Link> me.
